*  skidoo_redux.css : 2008.09.30 : ruthsarian@gmail.com
* -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
*  Skidoo is a three-column, float-based layout utilizing negative margins to 
*  provide column placement and cross-browser compatibility. There have been
*  several incarnations of this layout: original skidoo, skidoo too, and now
*  skidoo redux. This is the latest, most compatble and up-to-date version of
*  the skidoo layout available. It is recommended you use this layout and not
*  an older version of skidoo.
*
*  This layout is not for the faint of heart. Beginners will have problems
*  understanding the nuances, but through a little experimentation of different
*  variables, should be able to gain an understanding of what does what. For
*  experienced developers this is best served as a reference tool, explaining
*  what bugs are experienced on what browsing platforms for this and similar
*  layouts. It could be used as a map in working your way through bugs that
*  exist in your own layout. 
*
*  DISCUSSION TOPICS
*    - why left/right margins need (semi-)static widths (ie. no percentages)
*    - setting width of left/right columns
*    - why columns drop
*    - a general overview of float-based layouts and why they're "funny"

/*******************************************************************************
 * BASIC LAYOUT MECHANICS
 *
 * GENERAL NOTES
 *   - yes, that's a lot of DIVs for a three-column layout. there is a reason
 *     it all. first, all the columns must be floated to prevent a 3-pixel text
 *     jog (a bug) that IE/Win 6 and earlier have. I can't use CSS hacks around
 *     this one and need the extra markup. But using all floats can have
 *     positive consequences, especially when using floated elements that need
 *     to be cleared, but without clearing the other columns of the layout.
 *   - NEGATIVE MARGINS is an approach to the three-column CSS layout that seems
 *     to have the most compatibility and potential. the real strength of this
 *     idea is to have the ability to provide different colors (or images) as
 *     the background for each column. traditional three-column layouts can't
 *     do this because the columns are only as tall as needed to fit their
 *     content. in other words they don't run the full height of the layout.
 *     negative margins gives us a means to fake this functionality. borders
 *     (or padding, or margins) applied on #outer-column-container reserve the
 *     space where the left and right columns will live. all three columns are
 *     floated. since the columns are cleared inside #inner-column-container,
 *     #inner-column-container (and #outer-column-container) will be as tall as
 *     the tallest of the three columns. this means the borders will also be 
 *     this tall, giving the visual appearance that all three columns are the
 *     same height. 
 *
 * #page-container
 *   - wraps the entire page. use this to set min/max widths and set any margins
 *     or border that wraps the whole layout.
 *
 * #outer-column-container
 *   - reserves space for the left and right columns. using borders allows you
 *     to use the border color to act as the background color for the left and
 *     right columns. background color could then act as the background of the
 *     middle column.
 *
 * #inner-column-container
 *   - provides the single-pixel black border between the middle column and
 *     its outside brothers.
 *
 * #source-order-container
 *   - source ordered layouts place the main content at the top of the page. to
 *     do this with CSS in a three-column layout you need to wrap two of the
 *     three columns in an element (DIV) to float them together as if it was a
 *     a single column.
 *   - this element contains both the #middle-column and #left-column elements.
 *
 * #middle-column, #left-column, #right-column
 *   - containers for the each of the three columns in the layout
 *
 * #footer
 *   - bottom of your webpage. a place to put copyright and contact information
 *
 * .clear-columns
 *   - this class is assigned to an empty div placed after the last (floating)
 *     column inside a block that contains two or more floating columns. it 
 *     clears the floats, forcing the element containing the columns to 
 *     visually contain all of its columns. there are alternative approaches
 *     to clearing which do not require this extra markup (see
 *     http://www.positioniseverything.net/easyclearing.html) however I find
 *     this method is much more effective and compatible for the task at hand.
 *     also, it should be evident by now that markup bloat is not a concern
 *     with this particular layout.

/*******************************************************************************
 * HACKS
 *
 * Not all browsers are created equal. Many CSS engines behave differently
 * and can create discrepencies in the rendering of your layout across different
 * browsing platforms. These hacks are aimed to resolve those discrepencies
 * and provide a more consistent look to the layout.
 *
 * CSS hacks work by playing to a bug in the CSS engine or parser for a given 
 * browser. This forces the browser to either apply or ignore a rule that other
 * browsers wouldn't. This lets you apply rules to work around bugs in a specific
 * browser that would otherwise break the layout. 
 *
 * It's important that when you use a CSS hack you do so in a way that is as
 * specific in targeting the problem browser as possible. Some hacks might
 * work for two or three different platforms, but you only need to apply it on
 * one platform. You might find that this hack has no adverse effects on those
 * other two platforms right now, but in a later version the hack might create
 * problems. Save yourself the headache and do as much as you can to narrow
 * the target of a CSS hack as much as possible.
 *
 * COMMON HACKS USED HERE
 *
 * The star-html hack (* html) targets Internet Explorer, both Windows and Mac,
 * for versions 6 and earlier. There is no element higher up in the page
 * than the HTML element. IE seems to think otherwise. Rules applied to any
 * selector that begins with "* html" will be ignored by just about every
 * browser except Internet Explorer. So any selector given below that begins
 * with "* html" is targetted at Internet Explorer.
 *
 * The backslash-star comment hack targets IE/Mac. CSS comments end with an 
 * asterisk and forward slash. Anything after that closing comment mark will
 * be interpreted as as CSS rule. However if you prefix that closing comment
 * mark with a backslash, IE/Mac won't recognize that the comment has been
 * closed, but other browsers will. So any rules that come after the hacked
 * closing comment will be applied by any browser except IE/Mac until a 
 * non-hacked closing comment is found. 
 *
 * With the above two hacks outlined, it's possible to target IE on a specific
 * OS platform. This is important as the CSS and rendering engines for Mac and
 * Windows are completely different and have very different requirements in
 * terms of hacks.
 *
 * You may see other empty comments in wierd places, those are variations on
 * another comment hack to help target specific version of IE/Win (separating
 * IE 5 from IE6 typically). 
 *
 * One other you'll see is a height setting of 0.1%. This is to trigger
 * hasLayout (see reference section below). IE (at least pre-version 7) 
 * will automatically expand a box beyond it's set height if its content
 * is too tall. Setting height to 100% also works, but this can lead to
 * problems where an element that should only be a few pixels tall turns
 * out to be as tall as the rest of the page. By setting it to 0.1% you
 * minimize the chance of elements being set taller than they need to be.
 *
 * WHY USE HACKS?
 *
 * For compatibility sake. Specifics on what each hack does, and why its
 * used, is provided with the rule or ruleset in question. However, the 
 * majority of hacks used have to do with an internal property in IE
 * called hasLayout. The first item in the reference section below has
 * all you could ever want to know, and more, about hasLayout.

 * the space of the parent element (#inner-column-container) where we clear the
